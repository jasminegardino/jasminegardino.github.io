        <h2> Who was One Direction? </h2>
        <p class="fs-6" style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px"> One Direction was a British-Irish band "discovered" by Simon Cowell through X Factor in 2010. Instead of eliminating each of the future band members entirely because of their struggling auditions (three out of the five, were eliminated as solo artists), they put Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Harry Styles, Niall Horan, and Louis Tomlinson into a band—forming One Direction. They had no idea they would gain so much traction and become as famous as they were, one coming from working at a small bakery in Cranage, another with a love of football, and a small little Irish boy from Mullingar, Ireland. The band lasted from 2010 to March of 2015, claiming a hiatus for 18 months. It has now been 2,292 days since One Direction made their hiatus official—way longer than 18 months. Since then, each of the members have made their own solo careers and flourished on their own, but the lack of public interaction between the boys over the years has done nothing but disappoint fans.</p>
        

    <div style="color: white; background-color:rgb(65, 61, 61)">
        <h2 style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px"> The Start of the Hiatus </h2>
        <!-- We can create a list using two different kinds of lists -->
        <!-- "Unordered List <ul>" -->
        <!-- "Ordered List <ol>" -->
        <p style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px"> On March 25, 2015 Zayn Malik, the one known for hitting those high notes in the band's songs, announced he would be leaving One Direction. Fans were devastated to learn this news, hoping, praying it was purely a publicity stunt, but unfortunately it was the truth. He left in the middle of One Direction's fourth tour (and ultimately last), "On the Road Again Tour" but the other band members in order to not disappoint fans more, continued the tour without Zayn by their side. Being on the job constantly for the length of essentially five years, being run dry, the band deserved a much needed break. After Zayn's choice to leave the band, the last four band members made an executive decision to take a break for half a year, tours and all. Fans are unsure if they ever really meant to come back together after that time passed, but there was always still hope.</p>

        <h2 style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px"> Harry Styles </h2>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px"> The most recognizable out of the five, and who is currently teasing his fans with his upcoming third album Harry's House, is the one and only, Harry Styles. The newly turned 28 year-old, grew-up in Redditch, working at a local bakery before going onto X Factor on March 27, 2010. Hearing silence the first two years after going on hiatus from One Direction, Harry satisfied fans with news of his first single as a solo artist, Sign of the Times, via Twitter on March 31, 2017. The single was released on April 7, 2017 giving fans a good cry for the rest of the year. His self-titled album was released in its entirety on May 12, 2017 scaring fans not only because of the inability to handle the masterpiece the man created, but because of the genre of the sound it introduced that they had never heard from Mr. Styles during his entire career. Since then, he has become a pop sensation, releasing his second album, Fine Line in 2019, and his upcoming album Harry's House set to release on May 20th of this year. </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px"> Also, still not breathing. Harold really had to go and release “As It Was” like it was nothing. </p>

            <p style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px"> In Harry's four years of being a solo artist he has been nominated for three Grammy awards: Best Pop Vocal Album, Best Pop Solo Performance, and Best Music Video, all for his second album, Fine Line—winning Best Pop Solo Performance for his song “Watermelon Sugar.” His music video for “Adore You” was the one nominated for Best Music Video, but lost to Beyoncé's “BROWN SKIN GIRL.” Justice for Eroda. </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px"> Other than his music career, he's launched his own cosmetic brand Pleasing and has been the first man to be photographed solo on the cover of Vogue Magazine—which started a riot about toxic masculinity with Candace Owens. In 2017 he also started his acting career by starring as a side character in the movie Dunkirk, and is now set to be in two upcoming movies, My Policeman and Don't Worry Darling. He also has become Thanos' brother in Marvel's Cinematic Universe, Eros, as seen in the ending scene of Eternals late last year. </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px"> Oh, and let's not forget to mention the trend setter Mr. Harry Edward Styles exactly is, with his tattoos and style being the blueprint. </p>

        <p style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px"> The oldest, the most British, and the shortest out of the five, is of course Louis Tomlinson. After the band broke up, in 2016 Louis released his first solo single "Just Hold On" a collaboration with Steve Aoki. He continued to release a few singles after that, but held off on an entire solo album until teasing his fans in 2019 of his album Walls. His music genre has stayed similar to boy band pop, which has kept original Directioner fans thrilled. The man who's obsessed with the number twenty-eight, has been hinting of his next album on his Instagram and Twitter since 2021. In his ongoing World Tour (that was rescheduled due to Covid-19) he has sold out tickets in every venue he has performed at, despite being viewed as the band member from One Direction with the least amount of interaction. Before focusing more on his music career as a solo artist, he appeared as a judge on X Factor, assisting Simon Cowell (we do not like Simon, no one does).</p>

            <!-- "Ordered List <ol>" -->
            <p style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px"> Despite not earning any awards as a solo artist as of yet, he is sure to win some for the next album he is to release that fans can't wait for. On another note, his song “Only for the Brave” has become known as the gay anthem of the entire One Direction fandom—most if not all of their fans are part of the LGBTQIA community—using Louis as the safe place to freely express who they truly are. </p>

        <p style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px"> Zayn Malik was the first to leave the group—as we all know. March 25, 2015 was many people's worst day of their lives. It was the day we found out that Zayn officially wasn't going to continue his time with the rest of the boys. Most fans could tell this was the beginning of the end for One Direction. He wasted no time in starting as a solo artist, releasing “Pillowtalk” on January 29, 2016 which was the talk of the world for a while. He is the only one out of the boys that has and continues to collaborate with an assortment of artists on his albums and singles. His first album was Mind Of Mine released in 2016, Icarus Falls in 2018, and just last year he released Nobody Is Listening. The genre of music he has put out is very different from when he was in the band—one of the many reasons he left; the songs he had written while in the band were never given consideration by management—but loved nonetheless by fans, if not more than expected. Zayn is one of the most private out of the boys, making appearances every once in a while, but after the birth of his daughter Khai, he has rarely shared anything with fans, but did release a collaboration with Ingrid Michealson in the middle of last year. </p>

        <!-- div: "divide" dividing this next part in a new section -->

            <!-- "Unordered List <ul>" -->
            <!-- "Ordered List <ol>" -->
            <p style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px"> Zayn has stayed out of the spotlight as much as he can, not doing any live performances because of his fear of the stage and with the boys no longer up there with him, there's no way for that anxiety to dissipate. Fans have been disappointed about this, but they are very understanding about the reason as to why. Despite this, Zayn has won an array of awards for his music, especially when he first started as a solo artist the news of him leaving the band boosted his streams astronomically. </p>

        <p style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px"> The youngest and the Irish one, or better yet the one who was known as “the blonde one” while in the band, is Niall Horan. Since the band has split up, other than only talking about golf, Niall has released two albums, Flicker and Heartbreak Weather, and has collaborated with a few other artists but for the most part has stayed to himself while being a solo artist. His last album was released in 2020 (also happened to be the day COVID-19 took over our lives, did not realize that until recently), ever since the Irish princess has made it his duty to reply to fans with “Soon” when asked about when new music is coming. </p>
