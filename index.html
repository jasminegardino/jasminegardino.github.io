        <h2> Who was One Direction? </h2>
        <p> One Direction was a British-Irish band "discovered" by Simon Cowell through X Factor in 2010. Instead of eliminating each of the future band members entirely (three out of the five, were eliminated as solor artists), because of their struggling auditions, they put Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Harry Styles, Niall Horan, and Louis Tomlinson into a band - forming One Direction. They had no idea they would gain so much traction and become as famous as they were, one coming from working at a small bakery in Cranage, another with a love of football, and a small little Irish boy from Mullingar, Ireland. The band lasted from 2010 to March of 2015, claiming a time of hiatus for 18 months. It has now been 2,292 days since One Direction made their hiatus offical - way longer than 18 months. Since then, each of the members have made their own solo careers and flourished on their own, but the lack of public interaction between the boys over the years has done nothing but disappoint fans.  </p>

    <div style="color: white; background-color:rgb(65, 61, 61)">
        <h2> The Start of the Hiatus </h2>
        <!-- We can create a list using two different kinds of lists -->
        <!-- "Unordered List <ul>" -->
        <!-- "Ordered List <ol>" -->
        <p> On March 25, 2015 Zayn Malik, the one known for hitting those high notes in the band's songs, announced he would be leaving One Direction. Fans were devistated to learn this news, hoping, praying it was purely a publicity stunt, but unfortunately it was the truth. He left in the middle of One Direction's forth tour (and ultimately last), "On the Road Again Tour" but the other band members in order to not disappoint fans more, continued the tour without Zayn by their side. Being on the job constantly for the length of essentially five years, being run dry, the band deserved a much needed break. After Zayn's choice to leave the band, the last four band members made an executive decision to take a break for half a year, tours and all. Fans are unsure if they ever really meant to come back together after that time passed, but there was always still hope.  </p>

        <h2>Harry Styles</h2>
        <p> The most recognizable out of the five, and who is currently teasing his fans with his upcoming third album Harry's House, is the one and only, Harry Styles. The newly turned 28 year-old, grew-up in Redditch, working in a local bakery before going onto X Factor on March 27, 2010. Hearing silence the first two years after going on hiatus from One Direction, Harry satisfied news of his first single as a solo artist, Sign of the Times, via Twitter on March 31, 2017. The single was released on April 7, 2017 giving fans a good cry for the rest of the year. His self titled album was released in its entirety on May 12, 2017 scaring fans not only because of the inability to handle the masterpiece the man created, but because of the genre of sound it introduced that they had never heard from Mr. Styles during his entire career. Since then, he has become a pop sensation, releasing his second album, Fine Line in 2019, and his upcoming album Harry's House set to release on May 20th of this year.  </p>

            <p> In Harry's four years of being a solo artist he has been nominated for three Grammy awards, Best Pop Vocal Album, Best Pop Solo Performance, and Best Music Video for his second album Fine Line - winning Best Pop Solo Performance for his song Watermelon Sugar. </p>
           <p> Not only that, but he has made many monumental movements other than in his music career; being the first man to be photographed solo on the cover of Vogue, being the creative director of a cosmetic brand Pleasing, and started a riot about toxic masculinity with Candace Owens. </p>

        <p> The oldest, the most British, and the shortest out of the five, is of course Louis Tomlinson. After the band broke up, in 2016 Louis released his first solo single "Just Hold On" a collaboration with Steve Aoki. He continued to release a few singles after that, but held off on an entire solo album until teasing his fans in 2019 of his album Walls. His music genre has stayed similar to boy band pop, which has kept original directioner fans thrilled. In his ongoing World Tour, he has sold out seats in every arena he has played at, despite being the band member from One Direction with the least amount of interaction. He also appeared as a judge on X Factor during Season 15, assisting Simon Cowell. </p>
